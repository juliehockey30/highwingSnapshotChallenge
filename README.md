#ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT
I wanted to bring to your attention a few things that, given more time, I would definitely go back and cleanup/fix.

* For the "Marketing" toggle, I used the data called "brokerDivision" in the query and response. This was because of process of elimination.

* The app currently is NOT scaling appropriately. If you re-size the window, the styles get very messed up and you need to refresh the page before they go back to normal.

* This app has not yet been styled for mobile (desktop ONLY)
